   title:       Camlistore
   timeframe:   Jun.2014 to present
   description: "Camlistore is your personal storage system for life. It provides a set of open-source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing and synchronizing data. I stumbled across the project while researching ideas for a cloud-based photo organization service. Since that time I’ve been working on improving the user experience and adding new features to the web UI. In order to contribute to the back-end of the application I am currently learning Go."

   description: "As part of an effort to assist with the launch of a new SaaS offering, I developed a framework for evaluating user on-boarding practices to help reduce the friction of attracting and retaining new users.

   uid:         tuning
   title:       Web Application Performance Tuning
   timeframe:   Oct.2013 to Dec.2013
   description: "As part of a performance tuning effort for an existing customer portal, I was engaged to review the production log data and codebase to take steps to improve page-load time. To ease in the harvesting of application data I created a Python log parsing script to extract and aggregate active data queries and running times. Slow running queries were then optimized where required, but the majority of the work was identifying the common queries and eliminating duplicates per page by implementing a caching layer."

   uid:         testing
   title:       Test Suite Strategy, Design and Development
   timeframe:   Feb.2013 to Dec.2013
   description: "Working with a client focused on helping employers improve the wellness of their employees, the goal of the project was to update and migrate a large wellness assessment survey onto a more scalable and performant platform. The major risk factor was the faultless migration of complicated business logic onto the new system. I was engaged to design and build a comprehensive regression test suite to validate logic branching decisions, score calculations, and the resulting dynamic content which would be displayed to the end-user. I worked in conjunction with the development team to identify potential errors as the functionality was developed, so that when we received an initial test dataset of ~12,000 survey responses for validation, we were able to match all but 6 test cases, which were later found to be erroneous."

   timeframe:   Oct.2010 to present
   description: "The SSBLA hosts annual sled racing events. We have developed our own electronic sled race timing system complete with a drag race-inspired 'christmas tree' start light. The system is able to track racer time down the track as well as measure racer speed at the finish line. Current projects include wireless data transmission and persistence to the cloud, RFID racer identification, and even a cable-camera system for improving our on-track footage. Our initial implementation was written up on the MAKE blog!"

      description:  "One unique project involved migrating a massive wellness assessment survey onto a more scalable, responsive, and performant platform. The major risk factor was replicating the complex business logic and scoring calculations used for the ~350,000 annual participants. I was engaged to design and build a comprehensive regression testing utility to validate the new scoring algorithm. I worked in conjunction with the development team to identify potential errors as the functionality was developed, so that when we received an initial sample data set of ~12,000 survey responses to validate, we were immediately able to match all but 6 results, which were later found to be erroneous."

This application aggregated data from several systems to serve as single point of view to assess the overall health of the force. I oversaw it’s initial usage within smaller organizations and helped create the product roadmap to later acceptance at the senior leadership level. In addition to the parent dashboard container, we designed and documented an extendable child interface to allow externally developed ‘widgets’ (componentized functionality) to be incorporated into the application."
