summary: "I am a full-stack developer with ten years experience. My primary role is technical design and development but I have worked across the spectrum of project delivery including project management, user experience design, training and mentoring, and product leadership. I also have four years experience in a design studio creating physical products like architectural metalwork and sculpture. This diverse background has positively influenced my approach to problem solving and my perspective on design."

   description: "The SSBLA hosts annual sled racing events. We have developed our own electronic sled race timing system complete with a drag race-inspired 'christmas tree' start light. The system is able to monitor racer time down the track as well as measure speed at the finish line. Current projects include wireless data transmission and persistence to the cloud, RFID racer identification, and even a cable-camera system for improving our on-track footage. Our initial implementation was written up on the MAKE blog!"

   title:       Web Application Performance Tuning
   timeframe:   Oct.2013 to Dec.2013
   description: "As part of a performance tuning effort for an existing customer portal, I was engaged to review the production log data and codebase to take steps to improve page-load time. To ease in the harvesting of application data I created a Python log parsing script to extract and aggregate active data queries and running times. Slow running queries were then optimized where required, but the majority of the work was identifying the common queries and eliminating duplicates per page by implementing a caching layer."

   title:       Test Suite Strategy, Design and Development
   timeframe:   Feb.2013 to Dec.2013
   description: "The goal of this project was to migrate a large wellness assessment survey onto a better performing and more scalable platform. The major risk factor was the faultless migration of complicated business and scoring logic. I designed and developed a comprehensive regression test suite to validate logic branching decisions, score calculations, and the resulting dynamic content which would be displayed to the end-user. I worked in conjunction with the development team to identify potential errors as the functionality was developed, so that when we received an initial test dataset of ~12,000 survey responses for validation, we were able to match all but 6 test cases, which were later found to be erroneous."

   title:       The USAF Portal
   timeframe:   Sep.2007 to Apr.2009
   description: "The United States Air Force portal is a platform for strengthening community and sharing information with remotely stationed personnel. Our team created an incremental plan to migrate the application away from the BroadVision One to One Enterprise platform to a custom portal based upon open-source frameworks like Spring and Hibernate. Our initial effort moved the application from the BV Interaction Managers to IBM WebSphere Application Servers which alleviated request queueing issues and drastically improved page load times. We then began a substantial content and data migration effort from the BroadVision schema of 100+ tables to ~15 on the new schema. Additionally, we redesigned the portal UI to break the visual ties from the BroadVision paradigm of 'Pages / Portlets / Blocks'. We also built an entire content publishing and management system to serve the unique organizational structure and processes within the Air Force. Over the course of the project we were able to decommision five physical servers, eliminate $1M in annual licensing costs, and see application performance gains on the order of 350+%."
